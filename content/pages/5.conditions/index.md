overview: Conditions allow you filter the results of your content tags (e.g. Collections, Taxonomies) with the data inside them, much like WHERE clauses do with SQL.

## Usage {#usage}

The syntax is for all the available conditions is `field:condition="value"`.

For conditions where you may specify the comparison value, like `is` or `starts_with`, you'd do:

```
my_field:starts_with="something"
```

For boolean conditions, like `exists` or `null`, you should simply specify a value of `true`, to trigger the condition:

```
my_field:exists="true"
```

For negative boolean conditions, _don't_ use `="false"`. Instead, pick the opposite condition.  
For example, `:exists` vs. `:doesnt_exists`.

```
<!-- Don't do this: -->
my_field:exists="false"

<!-- Do this: -->
my_field:doesnt_exist="true"
```


## Example {#example}

Let's say we have a collection of beverages:

``` language-yaml
- Amaretto
- Bourbon Whiskey
- Gin
- Irish Whiskey
- Scotch Whisky
- Rye Whiskey
- Rum
- Vodka
```

But we only want to show whiskeys, because they are delicious.

```
{{ collection:drinks title:contains="whiskey" }}
    {{ title }}
{{ /collection:drinks }}
```

That would filter down to this:

``` language-yaml
- Bourbon Whiskey
- Irish Whiskey
- Rye Whiskey
```

We can't forget about Scotch, but since its spelled `whisky`, our condition filters it out.

Let's use a regular expression to make that `e` optional.

```
{{ collection:drinks title:match="/whiske?y/" }}
    {{ title }}
{{ /collection:drinks }}
```

Now Scotch will be in the list, and we can sleep soundly knowing that no whiskey was forgotten.

If you want narrow your results further you can repeat conditions as many times as needed.

```
{{ collection:drinks title:is="whiskey" country:is="scotland" }}
    {{ title }}
{{ /collection:drinks }}
```
