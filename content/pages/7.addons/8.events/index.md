title: Events Reference
overview: >
  Events serve as a great way to decouple various aspects of your addon, or even modify behavior or output of core functionality. A single event can have multiple listeners that do not depend on each other.
---

## Overview {#overview}

Simpler events are provided as a string with an argument passed through as a payload. For example, the `cp.page.published` event is dispatched as a string, and passes along the `Page` that was published.

```
public $events = [
    'cp.page.published' => 'doSomething'
];

public function doSomething($entry)
{
    //
}
```

Potentially more complicated events are provided as an event class. For example, when a page is deleted, the `Statamic\Events\Data\PageDeleted` class is dispatched. This class will be provided as the argument.

```
use Statamic\Events\Data\PageDeleted;

...

public $events = [
    PageDeleted::class => 'doSomething'
];

public function doSomething(PageDeleted $event)
{
    //
}
```
