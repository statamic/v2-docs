  One of the most crucial aspects of extending a Content Management System is being able to retrieve the data and manipulate it. The Statamic API and it's related classes provide you with ways to handle these sorts of situations.
---

Consider the various aspects of Statamic: Pages, Entries, Terms, Globals, and Assets. They are all `Data`. Data can have variables/fields that you can `get`, `set`, etc.

Some of these are also `Content`. Content can have URLs, slugs, publish statuses, etc.

Here's the inheritance structure:

``` .language-files
Data
|-- Content
|   |-- Page
|   |-- Entry
|   |-- Term
|   `-- GlobalContent
|-- Asset
`-- User
```

## Retrieving Data {#retrieving-data}

You should retrieve data using our API methods. If you've used Laravel, it should feel similar to Eloquent. If it helps, try thinking of each Data type mentioned above as a Model. We have an API class for each of those.

For example, this will find a page with an ID of `1`.

```
Statamic\API\Page::find(1);
// Returns an instance of \Statamic\Contracts\Data\Pages\Page
```

Like Laravel, if you're expecting a collection of models, you will receive a collection. However, Statamic will give you a subclass like `EntryCollection` which will do everything `Illuminate\Support\Collection` does [(docs)](https://laravel.com/docs/5.1/collections), with a few more contextual methods at your disposal should you need them.

If you're expecting a single model (like `Page::find(1)` above), you'll get the corresponding class.

## Manipulating Data {#manipulating-data}

Once you have a data instance, you can go to town on it.

```
$page->set('foo', 'bar');
```

This is like adding `foo: bar` to the front-matter of the page file.

Once you're done, go ahead and save it.

```
$page->save();
```

Now it'll be written to file. Nice.

## Creating Data {#creating-data}

Of course, the data had to get there somehow. You can also create data using the corresponding API classes.

Each of them has a `create()` method that will give you a [factory class][factories]. You can use that factory to build up your object.

```
use Statamic\API\Page;

$page = Page::create('/about') // The pages factory accepts a URI.
          ->order(2)
          ->published(true)
          ->with(['title' => 'About us', 'subtitle' => 'We are awesome'])
          ->get();
```

That `get()` at the end is how you get your newly built object  from the factory. Now you have a shiny new `Page`. Keep in mind that it doesn't exist anywhere until you `save()` it.

**Note:** Never manually do `new Page`. Use the factories.

## Localizing Data {#localizing-data}

To add localized data to an object, first target it "`in`" the locale.

```
$page->in('fr'); // returns a LocalizedData class
```

A `LocalizedData` class simply holds a locale and the object, and will pass any actions onto the object while targeting that locale.

```
$page->in('fr')->set('foo', 'le bar');
```

All the different locales are stored on the object itself. So when it comes time to `save()` it, Statamic will generate the appropriate files for you.

For example, `$page->save()` would write both `index.md` and `fr.index.md` for you.

**Note:** It's worth noting that even though the `Data` class can hold data in multiple locales, some data types are not (yet) capable of being localized.


## Content {#content}

Content is an extension of Data. Content is generally data that will be accessible on the front end. Pages, Entries, Taxonomy Terms, and Globals are all Content.

### URI {#uri}

When we talk about URIs in Statamic, we are referring to the identifying part of the URL that comes _after_ the root.

For example, a page that exists at `/carrot` has a URI of `/carrot`. Simple.

However you may have that page localized in Spanish as `/es/zanahoria`. The URI is `/zanahoria`. Notice that the locale prefix is omitted. This is because the root is `yoursite.com/es`.

**When retrieving data in Statamic using URIs, you should always use the default locale.**

```
$uri = \Statamic\API\URL::getDefaultUri('es', '/zanahoria'); // returns /carrot
```

### URL {#url}

Similar to a URI, a URL is the location from the domain root.

Using the example above, the URLs would be `/carrot` and `/es/zanahoria`, for English and Spanish, respectively.

Absolute URLs (or permalinks) include the domain. They would be `http://yoursite.com/carrot` and `http://yoursite.com/es/zanahoria`.

### Changing the routes file from addons
all classes come from `use Statamic\API\<Class>` namespace.

```
//get the routes file
$file = settings_path('routes.yaml');
//parse the routes file into an object
$allRoutes = YAML::parse(File::get($file));

//do what you need to do with the routes.
//in this example we're removing all routes which match:
// <some route>: some_template
$routes = $allRoutes['routes'];

foreach ($routes as $key => $value) {
  if($value === 'some_template') {
    unset($routes[$key]);
  }
}

$allRoutes['routes'] = $routes;

// we parse the array back into yaml
$contents = YAML::dump($allRoutes);
// and finally save the file.
File::put($file, $contents);

// you might also want to clear cache/stache
Cache::clear();
Stache::clear();
```
