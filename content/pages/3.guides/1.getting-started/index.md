overview: Everything you need to know (and a few things you don't) about getting Statamic up and running, followed by a grand tour of the folder structure.
---
Statamic is a self-hosted PHP application and requires a web server. You can run it locally on your computer with a compatible environment or any number of hosting solutions.

This guide will serve to walk you through setting up your first Statamic site,  getting familiar with the folder structure, and a few initial configurations.

# Licensing {#licensing}

Statamic is commercial software, so you'll need to a good human being and abide by the license agreement.

In a nutshell, you can use Statamic _locally_ without a license key, but as soon as you are using it on a _public_ domain, you'll need a key.

[Find out more about how the licensing works in a technical sense](/reference/recipes/licensing)

# Requirements {#requirements}

Statamic has a few system requirements. Not all servers are created equal and not all hosts play nice. Statamic v2 is built on [Laravel][laravel] so as a rule of thumb, anywhere Laravel runs, Statamic runs. You can even use [Forge][forge] + [Digital Ocean][do]. We do, and we love it. Anyway, here's what you're going to need.

## Server Requirements

- A web server: Apache, Nginx, or IIS
- PHP >= 5.5.9

## Required PHP Extensions

These should all be compiled in PHP 5.5.9+ by default but we find it's best to be thorough.

- [OpenSSL](http://php.net/manual/en/book.openssl.php)
- [Multibyte String](http://php.net/manual/en/book.mbstring.php)
- [Tokenizer](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/book.tokenizer.php)
- [JSON](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/book.json.php)
- [PCRE](http://php.net/manual/en/book.pcre.php)

## Optional
- [GD](http://php.net/manual/en/book.image.php) or [ImageMagick](http://php.net/manual/en/book.imagick.php)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)


## Suggested Development Environments {#dev-environments}

You can (and probably should) run Statamic _locally_ while you develop your site. There are a number of solutions that give you all the tools you need without having to compile anything by hand. But if you're into that, all the better. You can probably skip over the rest of this section.

### Mac: MAMP/MAMP Pro

The latest version of [MAMP and MAMP Pro][mamp] comes pre-loaded with Apache, PHP 5.5.9 and all the modules you need. Download, install, and go.

### Windows: WAMP

If you happen to be of the Microsoft persuasion, [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) is a good choice, and pretty similar to MAMP. So we hear.

### Homestead

Prefer a virtual environment? You’re in luck, [Laravel Homestead][homestead] is a pre-packaged Vagrant "box" that provides you a wonderful development environment without requiring you to install PHP, HHVM, a web server, or any other server software on your local machine. No more worrying about messing up your operating system! If something goes wrong, you can destroy and re-create the box in minutes.

Homestead runs on any Windows, Mac, or Linux system, and includes the Nginx web server, PHP 5.6, MySQL, Postgres, Redis, Memcached, Node, and all of the other goodies you need to develop amazing Laravel applications.

_Note: Homestead is not a **fast** local dev environment for applications that leverage lots of small files due to NFS sync delays. It's best to not use file sharing and run Statamic directly in your VM for best results._

You can try enabling NFS to speed up Homestead. In your `homestead.yaml`, add `type: "nfs"` to your `folders` array.

``` .language-yaml
folders:
  - map: ~/Code
    to: /home/vagrant/Code
    type: "nfs"
```

### CLI Server

_This method isn't recommended for any long-term development._

To get started very quickly, you can use Laravel's built-in server using our `please` command.

``` .language-bash
$ php please serve

Laravel development server started on http://localhost:8000/
```

Alternatively, you can use the plain PHP version (which the `please` command uses behind the scenes). You must
specify the `statamic/server.php` to use as a router.

``` .language-bash
$ php -S localhost:3000 statamic/server.php

PHP 5.6.10 Development Server started at Thu Jan 21 10:30:00 2016
Listening on http://localhost:3000
```

Note that some users are reporting issues with both of these options.


# Installing {#installing}

Grab the latest version of [statamic.com](http://statamic.com) and let's get to it.

## Step 1: Drop the files {#step-1-files}

Unzip your Statamic package into your web root. You'll see the following folders and files:

```language-files
webroot/
|-- assets/
|-- local/
|-- site/
|-- statamic/
|-- index.php
|-- please
|-- robots.txt
|-- sample.gitignore
|-- sample.nginx.conf
|-- sample.htaccess
|-- sample.web.config
```

### Running in a subdirectory {#subdir}

Gut check time. Do you want to run in a subdirectory for the right reason? Using Statamic in a `blog` subdirectory in an existing site is one such reason. Not feeling like setting up a virtual host isn't. We can't stop you, but if you plan to run the site in webroot in production, you should do the same thing in development.

Professional advice given, open up `index.php` and change `$site_root` from `"/"` to `"/name_of_your_subdirectory/"`. Good to go.

## Step 2: Set permissions {#permissions}

Statamic needs to be able to write to the 4 included folders, and their subfolders.

- `site`
- `local`
- `statamic`
- `assets`

In order to have write access, the necessary permissions depend on which system user PHP is running as and which user owns the files and folders. Here are some recommendations. When in doubt, bump it up:

- If they are the same user, use `744`.
- If they are the same group, use `774`.
- If they are neither the same user nor in the same group, or if you're tired of messing with this, just use `777`.

> Apply the permissions recursively so Statamic can write where it needs to.

The simplest way to apply the permissions is to use the following command. (You may need to prefix with `sudo`)

``` .language-bash
chmod -R 777 site local statamic assets
```

## Step 3: Configure URL rewrites {#rewrites}

Like most (if not all) PHP applications, all page requests are run through a single `index.php` file called a "front controller". This allows the page to be dynamically displayed from the CMS.

This step is technically optional, but professionally recommended. If you do nothing, all of your URLs will have that front controller present in them. It's not great for SEO and it looks silly, so you should remove it. Please remove it.

Here's how:

**Open `index.php` and set `$rewrite_urls` to `true`.** Then, depending on which type of server you're using, do the following:

### Apache

Make sure you have `mod_rewrite` enabled and rename the `sample.htaccess` file to `.htaccess`, taking special care to ensure that it's in the same directory as your `index.php` file. They're best friends, don't separate them.

If this doesn't work, you're most likely someone who doesn't follow defaults and runs your own flavor of configuration. Google is your friend. If you're _really_ stuck, we'll do our best to [help you](https://statamic.com/support).

### Nginx

Grab the settings from `sample.nginx.conf` and customize them as necessary. Nginx is a bit less "set it and forget it" than Apache, making further server configuration beyond the scope of this guide.

### IIS

We don't use Windows ourselves, but we've been told the included `sample.web.config` works. Do your thing.

## Step 4: Run the Trailhead Installer {#installer}

Technically there is no "install" process for Statamic, but we have a little tool that will check your environment for all the necessary requirements, file permissions, and even help you get your first User created. Head to `/installer.php` and let it take care of the rest for you.

**Once you're done, delete `installer.php`.**

## Step 5: You're done.

Now for some extra detail...

### About that License Key and Trial Mode

If you don't have a license key, that's okay! You can use Statamic in trial mode for as long as you'd like in your local development environment. Just be sure to [purchase](https://trading-post.statamic.com) and add the key to your system config before you launch, otherwise your users will simply see a *"Statamic Site Coming Soon!"* message.


### Moving Statamic Above Webroot (optional) {#above-webroot}

For extra security you can [move your system files](/reference/recipes/secure-installation) above webroot. This prevents system files from potentially being accessed through a browser.

### Multilingual Sites

If you'd like to support multiple languages, head over to the [Multilingual Guide][multilingual-guide] for a few additional steps.

# Updating {#updating}

Updating is even easier than installing.

## One-click Updates

Statamic has a one-click updater built into the Control Panel. When an update is available, users with Update permissions will see a badge in the sidebar next to the logo. Clicking on that badge will take you to a magical, bountiful land flowing with updates and releases.

Once here, all you need to do is click the **Update** button and watch as the work is done for you.

You can get to this section at any time by going to `Tools » Updater`. It's possible that you could beat the system and find an update before it makes it to the badge. Just keep refreshing. That's one way to live.

## Manual Updates

If you need to update your install by hand, download the latest version from [statamic.com](http://statamic.com) and replace your `statamic/` folder with the newest one.

If you have any addons, you should run `php please addons:refresh` to make sure any addons know an update has been run. If you don't have command line access, you can go to `Configure » Addons » Refresh` and run it there.

# Folder Tour {#folder-tour}

Now it's time to show you around so you know what everything is, where it goes, and why. If you love organization, it's time to get your smile on.

If you don't want or plan to manage your site by working directly with the files, you _can_ skip this section, but you're missing out on half the fun. As a general rule and approach, everything can be managed in both the [Control Panel][cp] and the files.

```language-files
webroot/
|-- statamic/
|-- site/
|-- local/
```

## statamic/ {.icon.icon-folder}

This folder contains Statamic, the application. Without it the party is over before it has even begun.

You should never edit anything in this folder directly because it will always get overwritten when you update. [Laravel][laravel], third-party composer dependencies, and all of our application code lies within. For a tour of _this_ area, you'll want to head over to the [Addon guide][addon-guide].

## site/ {.icon.icon-folder}

This is your kitchen. This is where Julia Child would write the recipe for her famous Boeuf Bourguignon. This is where Banksy keeps his unpublished Instagram photos. It's The Big House, the Studio, the all important hub of your masterpiece creation. Herein lies everything that constitutes your site and makes it yours. Content, templates, users, settings, all of it. If you version control one thing, it's this folder.

Let's look inside, shall we?

```language-files
site/
|-- addons/
|-- content/
|   |-- collections/
|   |-- globals/
|   |-- pages/
|   |-- taxonomies/
|-- settings/
|   |-- addons/
|   |-- environments/
|   |-- fieldsets/
|   |-- users/
|   |-- assets.yaml
|   |-- caching.yaml
|   |-- cp.yaml
|   |-- debug.yaml
|   |-- routes.yaml
|   |-- system.yaml
|   |-- theming.yaml
|   |-- users.yaml
|-- storage/
|-- themes/
|-- users/
```

### site/addons/ {.icon.icon-folder}

Addons live here. You can use the Control Panel's addon manager or drop them in there yourself. Each child folder is its own addon and can contain any number of files.

### site/content/ {.icon.icon-folder}

The four traditional Content Types all live here: Pages, Collections, Taxonomies, and Globals. [Learn more about Content Types][content-types]

### site/settings/ {.icon.icon-folder}

This is where all those preferences and site configuration _settings_ go. They're broken out into logical files and folders by responsibility.

  - `addons/` Each addon manages its own settings here.
  - `environments/`   It's common to have your site running in multiple places -- development, staging, and production for example -- and each site might need different settings here and there. Debugging, Analytics, etc. Each environment can have their own set of overrides here.
  - `fieldsets/` Fieldsets are reusable combinations of custom fields and fieldtypes that can be used by each of the Content Types. Each fieldset has its own file here.
  - `users/`  User _settings_ - like groups, roles, and permissions -- are kept here. Users are not. But their settings are. Just making it very clear.

### site/storage/ {.icon.icon-folder}

Data that needs to be stored permanently but is not necessarily "content" lives here. For example, Asset meta data or sales transactions might one day reside here, forever and ever, Amen. This is generally an area leveraged by Statamic or Addons directly.

### site/themes/ {.icon.icon-folder}

All of the various bits of code that go into a Statamic site: HTML templates, partials, CSS, JavaScript, and so on are grouped into a folder, called a "theme". You can switch between themes in your settings, allowing you to develop alternate looks and layouts or to create, buy, sell, download, share, and barter pre-designed themes at the [Trading Post][trading-post].

A Statamic theme is extremely flexible; allows great separation between content, layout, and style; and is full of reusable components. [Learn more about themes][themes].

### site/users/ {.icon.icon-folder}
  The users folder contains all of your site users, from the Control Panel admins to the folks that register on the front-end of your site to gain access to logged-in only content (if you're into that kind of thing). They are structured much like content files, but have some special attributes (like passwords). [Learn more about users][users].

## local/ {.icon.icon-folder}

This folder is for setting and forgetting. It's like a ladybug on your fingertip. Beautifully crafted but only in that one place for a moment. All the server-side, ephemeral (short-lived) caching and temporary storage lives here. It's all self-creating and self-destroying, and you definitely shouldn't version control it.

It's all organized and namespaced into concise areas of responsibility, none of which you'll ever have to worry about unless you want to extend Statamic with [your own Addons][addon-guide].

As long as this folder has the [proper permissions](#permissions), you can simply leave it be.
