## Example {#example}

The most basic example would be to iterate over entries in a single collection:

```
{{ collection from="blog" }}
    {{ title }}
{{ /collection }}
```

You can also use the shorthand syntax for this:

```
{{ collection:blog }}
    {{ title }}
{{ /collection:blog }}
```

If you'd like to fetch entries from multiple collections, you can only do that in the standard syntax, like so:

```
{{ collection from="blog|events" }}
    {{ title }}
{{ /collection }}
```

## Grouping entries by date {#group_by_date}

You can visually group repeating date-based entries.

When using this parameter, the templating structure you need to use will be a little different from a regular loop.

### Example

Let's assume that the entries in the `blog` collection are date-based.


```
{{ collection:blog group_by_date="M Y" as="entries" }}
    {{ date_groups }}
        <h3>{{ date_group }}</h3>
        <ul>
            {{ entries }}
                <li>{{ title }}</li>
            {{ /entries }}
        </ul>
    {{ /date_groups }}
{{ /collection:blog }}
```

The code above will output something like this:

```
<h3>May 2015</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A post from May</li>
  <li>Another from May</li>
</ul>
<h3>June 2015</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A post from June</li>
</ul>
```

The `{{ date_group }}` variable will be the date formatted by whatever you specifed in the `group_by_date` parameter.

The `{{ entries }}{{ /entries }}` tag pair will allow you to iterate over the entries in that date group. The name of this variable is specified by the `as` parameter. For example, if you used `as="posts"`, you'd use a `{{ posts }}{{ /posts }}` tag pair.

### Grouping by a custom date field {#group_by_date-custom-field}

If you'd like to group by an arbitrary date field, you can specify the field name as the second value of the parameter.

```
{{ collection:blog group_by_date="M Y|purchase_date" sort="purchase_date" }}
```

Here we are grouping on the `purchase_date` field. Note that you should also sort by that field, as the default sorting
on date-based entries would still be the entry date.


## Filtering {#filtering}

There are a number of ways to filter your collection. There's the conditions syntax for filtering by fields, taxonomy filter for using terms, and the custom filter class if you need extra control.

### Conditions syntax {#conditions}

Want to get entries where the title has the words "awesome" and "thing", and "joe" is the author? You can write it how you'd say it:

```
{{ collection:blog
   title:contains="awesome"
   title:contains="thing"
   author:is="joe"
}}
```

There are a bunch of conditions available to you, like `:is`, `:isnt`, `:contains`, `:starts_with`, and `:is_before`. There are many more than that. In fact, there's a whole page dedicated to [conditions - check them out][conditions].

### Taxonomies {#taxonomies}

Filtering by a taxonomy term (or terms) is done using the `taxonomy` parameter, similar to the conditions syntax mentioned above.

To show entries with the `harry-potter` term within the `tags` taxonomy, you could do this:

```
{{ collection:blog taxonomy:tags="harry-potter" }}
```

There are a number of different ways to use this parameter. They are explained in depth in the 
[Taxonomies Guide](/taxonomies#collections)


### Custom filters {#custom-filters}

Doing something complicated? You can reference a [custom filter][custom_filters] which can do the heavy lifting from outside of the template.

For example, want to filter drink entries by whether or not its one of the user's favorites?

```
{{ collection:drinks filter="users_favorite" }}
```

This'll load a custom filter file and do its thing from within there. Statamic makes the collection available to you, and you can manipulate it however you like. For example:

``` language-php
class UsersFavoriteFilter extends Filter
{
    public function filter()
    {
        $faves = User::getCurrent()->get('favorite_drinks');

        return $this->collection->filter(function($entry) use ($faves) {
            return in_array($entry->get('title'), $faves);
        });
    }
}
```

[Read more about custom filters][custom_filters].

## Pagination {#pagination}

To enable pagination mode, add the `paginate="true"` parameter, along with the `limit` parameter to specify the number of entries in each page.

```
{{ collection:blog limit="10" paginate="true" as="posts" }}

    {{ if no_results }}
        <p>Aww, there are no results.</p>
    {{ /if }}

    {{ posts }}
        <article>
            {{ title }}
        </article>
    {{ /posts }}

    {{ paginate }}
        <a href="{{ prev_page }}">⬅ Previous</a>

        {{ current_page }} of {{ total_pages }} pages
        (There are {{ total_items }} posts)

        <a href="{{ next_page }}">Next ➡</a>
    {{ /paginate }}

{{ /collection:blog }}
```

In pagination mode, your entries will be scoped (in the example, we're scoping them into the `posts` tag pair). Use that tag pair to loop over the entries in that page.

The `paginate` variable will become available to you. This is an array containing data about the paginated set.

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `next_page` |	The URL to the next paginated page.
| `prev_page` |	The URL to the previous paginated page.
| `total_items` |	The total number of entries.
| `total_pages` |	The number of paginated pages.
| `current_page` |	The current paginated page. (ie. the x in the ?page=x param)
| `auto_links` |	Outputs a Twitter Bootstrap ready list of links.
| `links` |	Contains data for you to construct a custom list of links.
| `links:all` |	An array of all the pages. You can loop over this and output {{ url }} and {{ page }}.
| `links:segments` |	An array of data for you to create a segmented list of links.

<br>

### Pagination Examples

The `auto_links` tag is designed to be your friend. It'll save you more than a few keystrokes, and even more headaches.
It'll output a Twitter Bootstrap-ready list of links for you. With a large number of pages, it will create segments
so that you don't end up with hundreds of numbers. You will see something like this:

![](/assets/examples/pagination-auto-links.png)

It's clever enough to work out a comfortable range of numbers to display, and it'll also throw in the prev/next arrow for good measure. Nice, right?

Maybe the Bootstrap markup isn't for you. You want something more custom. You're a maverick. That's cool. You'll want to check out the `links:all` or `links:segments` arrays. These give you all the data you need to recreate your own set of links. The `links:all` array is simply _all_ the pages with `url` and `page` variables. The `links:segments` will contain the segments like we mentioned earlier. You'll be able to access `first`, `slider`, and `last`, which are the 3 segments.

Here's the `auto_links` output, recreated using the other tags, for you mavericks out there:

```
{{ paginate }}
    <ul class="pagination">
        {{ if prev_page }}
            <li><a href="{{ prev_page }}">&laquo;</a></li>
        {{ else }}
            <li class="disabled"><span>&laquo;</span></li>
        {{ /if }}

        {{ links:segments }}

            {{ first }}
                {{ if page == current_page }}
                    <li class="active"><span>{{ page }}</span></li>
                {{ else }}
                    <li><a href="{{ url }}">{{ page }}</a></li>
                {{ /if }}
            {{ /first }}

            {{ if slider }}
                <li class="disabled"><span>...</span></li>
            {{ /if }}

            {{ slider }}
                {{ if page == current_page }}
                    <li class="active"><span>{{ page }}</span></li>
                {{ else }}
                    <li><a href="{{ url }}">{{ page }}</a></li>
                {{ /if }}
            {{ /slider }}

            {{ if slider || (!slider && last) }}
                <li class="disabled"><span>...</span></li>
            {{ /if }}

            {{ last }}
                {{ if page == current_page }}
                    <li class="active"><span>{{ page }}</span></li>
                {{ else }}
                    <li><a href="{{ url }}">{{ page }}</a></li>
                {{ /if }}
            {{ /last }}

        {{ /links:segments }}

        {{ if next_page }}
            <li><a href="{{ next_page }}">&raquo;</a></li>
        {{ else }}
            <li class="disabled"><span>&raquo;</span></li>
        {{ /if }}
    </ul>
{{ /paginate }}
```

## Aliasing {#alias}

Often times you'd like to have some extra markup around your list of entries, but only if there are results. Like a `<ul>` element, for example. You can do this by _aliasing_ the results into a new variable tag pair. This actually creates a copy of your data as a new variable. It goes like this:

```
{{ collection:blog as="posts" }}
  <ul>
  {{ posts }}
    <li><a href="{{ url }}">{{ title }}</a></li>
  {{ /posts }}
  </ul>
{{ /collection:blog }}
```

## Scoping {#scope}

Sometimes not all of your entries have the same set of variables. And sometimes the page that you're on (while listing entries in a Collection, for example) may have those very same variables on the page-level scope. Statamic assumes you'd like to fallback to the parent scope's data to plug any holes. This logic has pros and cons, and you can [read more about scoping and the Cascade here](/knowledge-base/cascade).

You can assign a _scope_ prefix to your entries so you can be sure to get the data you want. Define your scope and then prefix all of your variables with it.

```{.language-yaml}
# Page data
featured_image: /img/totes-adorbs-kitteh.jpg
```

```
{{ collection:blog scope="post" }}
  <div class="block">
    <img src="{{ post:featured_image }}">
  </div>
{{ /collection:blog }}
```

You can also add your scope down into your [alias](#alias) loop. Yep, we thought of that too.

```
{{ collection:blog as="posts" }}
  {{ posts scope="post" }}
    <div class="block">
      <img src="{{ post:featured_image }}">
    </div>
  {{ /posts }}
{{ /collection:blog }}
```

Combining both an Alias and a Scope on a Collection Tag doesn't make a whole lot of sense. You shouldn't do that.
