parse_content: false
overview: |
  With nothing but a URI, or list of URIs, you can fetch all available data regardless of the content type. It is a friend to pages, entries, and taxonomies alike.
description: Fetch data by one or more URLs regardless of content type.
parameters:
  -
    name: from
    type: any local URI
    description: Pass a local URI as a literal string, variable, or pipe delimited list, and all retrieved data will be available inside the tag pair, in the currently active language. The slug doesn't need to be the localized one.

    type: integer
    description: Limit the total results when fetching multiple content files.
  -
    name: offset
    type: integer
    description: Offset the total results when fetching multiple content files.

    name: show_unpublished
    type: boolean *false*
    description: Unpublished content is, by it's very nature, unpublished. That is, unless you show it by turning on this parameter.
  -
    name: show_future
    type: boolean *false*
    description: Date-based entries from the future are excluded from results by default. Of course, if you want to show upcoming events or similar content, flip this switch.

## Example {#example}

Let's use the Redwood demo site as an example. Say we want to fetch the Niles Peppertrout's "Fun Facts" and display a random one in the footer of our site.
If we looked at the `about/index.md` page we would see that there's a variable list called `fun_facts`. That's what we want.

In addition to the `get_content` tag, we'll be using the [shuffle](#) and [limit](#) modifiers to get one item from the list at random, and the [join](#) modifier to collapse an array into a string. This is just one of many ways you could achieve the same result.

```
{{ get_content from="/about" }}
  <blockquote>
    {{ fun_facts | shuffle | limit:1 | join }}
  </blockquote>
{{ /get_content }}
```
