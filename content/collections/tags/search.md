## Overview

An overview on how to _configure_ search, indexing, and the query form can be found in the [Search Docs](/search).


## Example

On a search result page, you can loop through the results of the search like they were entries or pages. Because they are. You'll have access to all the data of all the content returned so you can format your results however you'd like. In this example, we're displaying a truncated vresion of the `content` field.

```
{{ search:results }}

	{{ if no_results }}
		<h2>No results.</h2>
  {{ else }}

    <a href="{{ url }}" class="result">
      <h2>{{ title }}</h2>
      <p>{{ content strip_tags="img|a|p" safe_truncate="180|..." }}</p>
    </a>
    
  {{ /if }}

{{ /search:results }}
```

## Distinguishing Content Types

You can use the following helper variables to check and display (or not display) results by content type:

- `is_page` 
- `is_entry`
- `is_term`
