## Usage {#usage}

This tag has the same functionality as the [collection](collection) tag, with some differences.

The `pages` tag will attempt to get the child pages of a specified parent page.

For example, given this page structure:

``` .language-files
about/
|-- index.md
|-- 1.team/
|   |-- 1.board/
|   |   |-- index.md
|   |-- index.md
|-- 2.news/
|   |-- index.md
```

```
{{ pages from="/about" }}
   {{ order }}. {{ title }}
{{ /pages }}
```

``` .language-output
1. Team
2. News
```

Notice only the immediate child pages are output. If we wanted to get the next level, we can specify the `depth` parameter.

```
{{ pages from="/about" depth="2" }}
   {{ order }}. {{ title }}
{{ /pages }}
```

``` .language-output
1. Board
1. Team
2. News
```

Notice that (by default) the pages are being sorted by the order key, then alphabetically. They are also displayed in a
single list, as siblings. If you'd like to output the hierarchy, you should use the [Nav Tag](/tags/nav).

[collection]: /tags/collection
