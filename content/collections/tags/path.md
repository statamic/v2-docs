## Usage {#usage}
This tag will ensure that the site root is prepended to the beginning of a string. It's especially useful when [running in a subdirectory](/knowledge-base/subdirectory-installation).

The site root is defined in `system.yaml`'s `locales` array in the `url` value for your locale. For example:

``` .language-yaml
locales:
  en:
    url: /
```

Assuming site root is `/`:

```
{{ path src="contact" }}
{{ path src="contact" absolute="true" }}
```

``` .language-output
/contact
http://example.com/contact
```

Assuming site root is `/subdirectory/`:

```
{{ path src="contact" }}
{{ path src="contact" absolute="true" }}
```

``` .language-output
/subdirectory/contact
http://example.com/subdirectory/contact
```

Assuming site root is `http://example.com/`:

```
{{ path src="contact" }}
{{ path src="contact" absolute="true" }}
```

``` .language-output
http://example.com/contact
http://example.com/contact
```

### Localization with different slugs {#localization_diff_slugs}

If you have two different slugs for your local content (like /en/features and /de/funktionen), you need to reference the ID (found in the corresponding yaml file) instead of the slug.

```
{{ path src="72c016c6-cc0a-4928-b53b-3275f3f6da0a" }}
```
