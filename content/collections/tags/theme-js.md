## Example {#example}
```
{{ theme:js src="scripts" }}
```
``` .language-output
/site/themes/redwood/js/scripts.js
```

If you leave off the `src` parameter, the tag will use the theme name as the filename.

```
{{ theme:js }}
```

``` .language-output
/site/themes/redwood/js/redwood.js
```

Add the `tag` parameter to output a `script` tag.

```
{{ theme:js src="scripts" tag="true" }}
```
``` .language-output
<script src="/site/themes/redwood/js/scripts.js"></script>
```
