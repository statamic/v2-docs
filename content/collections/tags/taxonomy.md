    name: show
    type: string
    description: >
      Set this to `all` to show all taxonomy terms. This will prevent any filtering of the underlying

  -
    name: until
    type: string/var

      The inverse of `since`, but sets the _max_
      date.
  -
    name: sort
    type: 'string *results*'

      Filter the listing by either a custom

## Example {#example}

### Shorthand Syntax {#shorthand-syntax}

A simple listing of taxonomies in the `categories` group.

```
<h2>Categories</h2>
<ul>
  {{ taxonomy:categories }}
    <li><a href="{{ url }}">{{ title }}</a></li>
  {{ /taxonomy:categories }}
</ul>
```

### Verbose syntax {#verbose-syntax}

The verbose syntax is useful if you need to pass the taxonomy as a parameter.

```
<h2>Categories</h2>
<ul>
  {{ taxonomy use="categories" }}
    <li><a href="{{ url }}">{{ title }}</a></li>
  {{ /taxonomy }}
</ul>
```

## Collection {#collection}

The `taxonomy` tag allows you to iterate over taxonomies, but in each iteration, you also have access to all the corresponding content.

```
{{ taxonomy:categories }}
  <h2>{{ title }}</h2>
  <ul>
    {{ collection }}
      <li><a href="{{ url }}">{{ title }}</a></li>
    {{ /collection }}
  </ul>
{{ /taxonomy:categories }}
```

``` .language-output
<h2>News</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/blog/breaking">A breaking story!</a></li>
  <li><a href="/blog/so-interesting">An interesting article</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Events</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/events/walk-in-the-park">A walk in the park</a></li>
  <li><a href="/events/summer-camp">Summer camp</a></li>
</ul>
```

## Filtering {#filtering}

There are two options when it comes to filtering. There's the conditions syntax, and the custom filter class. You can't use both at the same time, so pick your poison.

### Conditions syntax {#conditions}

The conditions syntax will allow you filter the content in the underlying collection - not the actual taxonomy listing itself.

Want to get entries where the title has the words "awesome" and "thing", and "joe" is the author? You can write it how you'd say it:

```
{{ taxonomy:categories
   title:contains="awesome"
   title:contains="thing"
   author:is="joe"
}}
```

There are a bunch of conditions available to you, like `:is`, `:isnt`, `:contains`, `:starts_with`, and `:is_before`. There are many more than that. In fact, there's a whole page dedicated to [conditions - check them out][conditions].


### Custom filters {#custom-filters}

Doing something complicated? You can reference a [custom filter][custom_filters] which can do the heavy lifting from outside of the template.

The filter will get the taxonomy collection instance, _not_ the content collection. However, you can access that from within the taxonomy collection.
