## Usage {#usage}
This tag is similar to the [Glide Tag][glide_tag] with a few differences:

- It's a tag pair.
- There's no shorthand syntax.
- Images are generated immediately.

This tag can be useful if you need to know the dimensions of the resized image before it's rendered.

## Example {#example}

We have an image's asset ID saved in the YAML, and we want to resize it to 300x200, fit it inside the area by cropping it, and apply a sepia filter.

``` language-yaml
image: "380dc8d9-481c-4d18-9162-ecd5688f98a8"
```

```
{{ glide:generate src="{image}" width="300" height="200" fit="crop" filter="sepia" }}
  <img src="{{ url }}" width="{{ width }}" height="{{ height }}" />
{{ /glide:generate }}
```

``` .language-output
/img/id/380dc8d9-481c-4d18-9162-ecd5688f98a8?w=300&h=200&fit=crop&filt=sepia&s=3982hf983f2mf90r23
```
