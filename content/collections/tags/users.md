This tag has the same functionality as the [collection](collection) tag, including the ability to use [scoping](collection#scope). It does have some differences, though.

The first big and obvious difference, is that the collection you're working with is all of your users.

## Example {#example}

Here we will loop over the users with gmail email addresses.

```
<ul>
  {{ users email:ends_with="@gmail.com" }}
    <li>{{ username }}</li>
  {{ /users }}
</ul>
```

[collection]: /tags/collection
