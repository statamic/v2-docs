title: Assets
overview: >
    Used to retrieve Assets data from either an [Asset Fieldtype](/fieldtypes/assets) or directly from an Container.
    Your site's Assets are managed and stored independently of your pages and entries and have a joined relationship through their `id`. [Learn more about Assets](/assets).

      of the field containing an array of asset IDs.
  -
    name: id|container

## Usage {#usage}

The most basic usage is to iterate over an array of asset IDs. The tag takes its second segment from the name of the variable you wish you connect to. For example, if you have an `images` field, you would use `{{ assets:images }}`.

Here's an example of some Assets in use.

``` .language-yaml
bacon_images:
  - 89jf89r32-fdsmar39ifm9-932c9m3j3
  - 2n329ofna-90fjqp49j9fr-e98rjaa82
```

```
{{ assets:bacon_images }}
  <img src="{{ url }}" alt="{{ alt }}" /> Size: {{ size }}
{{ /assets:bacon_images }}
```

``` .language-output
<img src="/assets/applewood-smoked.jpg" alt="Applewood" /> Size: 355kb
<img src="/assets/canadian-bacon.jpg" alt="Canadian" /> Size: 125kb
```

### Single Assets {#single-assets}

If you have an asset field with `max_items: 1` the data will be saved as a `string`. As one cannot iterate over a string, the tag will adjust accordingly without complaining.

``` .language-yaml
hero_image: f9ruqp-pjo32n43ojn3-rijo3209
```

```
{{ assets:hero_image }}
<img src="{{ url }}" />
{{ /assets:hero_image }}
```

``` .language-output
<img src="/assets/img/superman.jpg" />
```

### Asset (singular) Tag {#asset-singular-tag}

You may have noticed that "Assets" is plural.  If you have an array of assets and only want the first or if it bothers you that a plural-powered Tag would return a single asset, we have you covered. We also support the singular word `Asset` for the explicit purpose of only ever accessing a single Asset.

``` .language-yaml
hero_image: f9ruqp-pjo32n43ojn3-rijo3209
```

```
{{ asset:hero_image }}
<img src="{{ url }}" />
{{ /asset:hero_image }}
```

``` .language-output
<img src="/assets/img/quailman.jpg" />
```

### Retrieving assets from a container or folder {#retrieving-assets-from-a-container-or-folder}

It may be desirable to loop over all the assets in a container or folder instead of needing to pick out assets manually using a field.

In this case, you may omit the second tagpart, and use parameters to drive the tag.

```
{{ assets container="123-456-789" }}
    <img src="{{ url }}" />
{{ /assets }}
```

Knowing the ID of the container isn't always an option. It may be simpler to specify the path. (This corresponds to
the `path` within a `container.yaml`).

```
{{ assets path="assets" }}
    <img src="{{ url }}" />
{{ /assets }}
```

Lastly, you may target a specific folder in a container, if you wish.

```
{{ assets path="assets" folder="img" }}
    <img src="{{ url }}" />
{{ /assets }}
```
