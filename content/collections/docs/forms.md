  Forms are a natural part of the internet experience and a core component of most websites. From "Contact Us" to "Vote for Your Favorite Naked Mole Rat", Statamic can help manage your forms and make your life a little easier.

## Overview {#overview}

Statamic forms can be used to collect, report, and even reuse and display user submitted data. Statamic's Form solution includes Tags, various settings, and a dedicated area of the Control Panel for viewing submitted responses.

## Your first form {#create}

Let's pretend you are Johnny Depp's web developer. You've been tasked with collecting electronic fan mail (we'll call it ef-Mail). You want to collect the following bits of info from <del>crazed</del> enthusiastic fans:

- name
- age
- level of adoration (appreciation, fixation, or obsession)
- message

### Create a formset {#create-the-formset}

The first thing you'll need to do is create a Formset. Each formset has its own settings, felds, and validation rules. Head to `/cp/forms` in the Tools area of the Control Panel and click the **Create Form** button. 

Alternately you can create a `.yaml` file in `site/settings/formsets` which will contain the form fields and settings. In that case you also use arbitrary settings that will be passed to the template, for example `type`.

Each form should contain a title and a set of fields with [validation rules][rules]. Optionally it may also have metrics and email configuration. Fields can be created similar to how fieldsets work for regular Statamic content.

Go ahead and create the four aforementioned fields. Once configured you will have a formset file that mike look something like this:

```.language-yaml
title: Super Fans

fields:
  name:
    display: Name
    validate: required
  age:
    display: Favorite Number
    validate: required|integer
  adoration:
    display: Level of Adoration
    validate: required
  message:
    display: Message
    validate: required
```

### The Template {#the-template}

Next, we need to set up the form in your template. Forms work just like standard HTML forms, except `<form></form>` open and close tags are replaced with `{{ form:create }}{{ /form:create }}` Statamic tags, which take care of setting actions, CSRF tokens for security, and a few other things automatically.

Next, the form inputs can be written one of two basic ways. The first is to loop through your form's fields like so:

```
{{ form:create in="superfans" }}
  {{ fields }}
    <label>{{ display }}</label>
    <input type="text" name="{{ field }}" value="{{ old }}" />
  {{ /fields }}
{{ /form:create }}
```

Or alternately, you can take a full-control approach and write out all the inputs yourself. This is useful when all of your fields aren't uniform -- when certain aspects require more control. We usually do it this way to reduce complexity. In this case, your template might look more like this:

```
{{ form:create in="superfans" }}
  <label>Name</label>
  <input type="text" name="name" value="{{ old:name }}" />

  <label>Age</label>
  <input type="text" name="age" value="{{ old:age }}" />

  <label>Level of Adoration</label>
  <select name="adoration">
    <option>Appreciation</option>
    <option>Fixation</option>
    <option>Obsession</option>
  </select>

  <label>Your Message</label>
  <textarea name="message">{{ old:message }}</textarea>

{{ /form:create }}
```

Next you can check out some of the other [Form Tags][tags] available to you to display any errors, show a success message, and so on. We'll keep this example brief and you can explore those at leisure.

## Viewing submissions {#viewing-submissions}

The Control Panel enables you to explore the collected responses, configure dashboards with reporting metrics, and export that data to CSV or JSON formats.

![Forms](/assets/img/screenshots/cp-forms.png)

You can jump back into your form's settings and pick which fields you want shown and set up metrics you'd like shown above your responses. Here's an example:

![Metrics](/assets/img/screenshots/cp-metrics.png)

These metrics would have a configuration like so:

```language-yaml
metrics:
  -
    type: total
    label: Total Responses
  -
    type: average
    field: age
    label: Average Age
    precision: 1
```

You have access to `average`, `sum`, `min`, `max`, and `total` metrics that can be applied to any field in your form.

## Displaying submission data

You can display any or all of the submissions of your forms on the front-end of your site using the [formsubmissions][submissions] Tag.

```
<h2>My fans have said some things you can't forget...<h2>
{{ form:submissions in="superfans" limit="15" }}
  {{ message | markdown }}
{{ /form:submissions }}
```

## Exporting your data

Exporting your data is as easy as click the **Export** button when viewing your form in the Control Panel. You have the choice between CSV and JSON. Choose wisely.

## Emails {#emails}

Allowing your fans to send their comments is all well and good, but at this point you will only know about it when you
head back into the Control Panel to view the submissions. Wouldn't it be better to get notified? It's simple to send
an email when a form is submitted.

You can add any number of emails to your formset.

``` .language-yaml
email:
  -
    to: hello@celebrity.com
    from: website@celebrity.com
    subject: You've got fan mail!
    template: fan-mail
  -
    to: agent@celebrity.com
    subject: Someone still likes your client
    automagic: true
```

Here we'll send two emails for every submission of this form. One will go to the celebrity, and one to the agent.
The first one uses a Statamic template, the other gets an "automagic" email. The automagic email will be a simple
list of all the fields and values in the submission.

### Setting the "Reply To" {#setting-the-reply-to}

If you want to set the `reply_to` to be the user submitting the form, you can configure that quite simply. Assuming you have a form input with `name="email"`:

``` .language-yaml
email:
  -
    reply_to: "{{ email }}"
    # other settings here
```

## File Uploads {#file-uploads}

Sometimes your fans want to show you things they've created, like scissor-cut love letters and innocent selfies with cats. No problem! File input types to the rescue. All you need to do is inform Statamic that you intend to collect files, specify where you'd like the uploads to go, and whether you'd like them to simply be placed in a directory somewhere, or become reusuable Assets.

First up, add `files="true"` to  your form tag. (This will add `enctype="multipart/form-data"` to the generated `<form>` tag. That's always so difficult to remember.)

```
{{ form:create formset="contact" files="true" }}
...
{{ /form:create }}
```

Then the fields:

```
<input type="file" name="simple" />
<input type="file" name="fancy" />
```

``` .language-yaml
fields:
  simple:
    type: file
    destination: uploads/
  fancy:
    type: asset
    container: uploads
    folder: fan-art
```

**Simple Uploads**: Set `type: file` and a `destination` (path from webroot). That's it.

**Asset Uploads**: Set `type: asset`, specify the asset `container` via handle or ID, and which folder inside said container.

### Multiple files {#multiple-files}

You have two methods available to you:

First, You can create separate fields for each upload. This is useful if each has a separate purpose, like Resume, Cover Letter, and Headshot. You'll need to explicitly create each and every one in your formset.

Or, you can enable multiple files on one field, by setting type with the plural form of the type option, `files` or `assets`, and indicating an array in your input by adding a set of square brackets to the `name` attribute.

```
<input type="file" name="many[]" />
```

``` .language-yaml
fields:
  many:
    type: files
    destination: uploads/
```

_Note: If you use the square bracket `name` syntax, but use the singular `type` in your formset, only the first selected
file will be uploaded. So don't forget to set both._

## Honeypot {#honeypot}

Simple and effective spam prevention.

The honeypot technique is simple. Add a field to your forms, that when filled in will cause the submission to fail.
Hide this field a method of your choosing (ie. CSS), so your users won't see it but spam bots will just think itâ€™s another field.

For example:

```
{{ form:create }}
    ...
    <input type="text" name="honeypot" class="honeypot" />
{{ /form:create }}
```

``` .language-css
.honeypot { display: none; }
```

If you're worried about smarter spam bots realizing that the honeypot field is named `honeypot`, you may customize the
name of the field by adding `honeypot: something` to your formset.

_Note: We say the submission will "fail", but that's not exactly true. On the front end, it will appear that the form was
submitted successfully. However, nothing will get saved, no emails will be sent, etc. This is the key to
tricking bots into believing everything went smoothly._
