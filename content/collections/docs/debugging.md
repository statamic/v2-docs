  You have a website, some data, templates, and you're not writing PHP anywhere. How on earth do you look under the hood? Know when something is broken? Fine-tune performance? Excellent question. Here come the answers.

## Debug Mode {#debug-mode}

Enabling Debug Mode in `System » Settings » Debugging` in the control panel, or with `debug: true` in `site/settings/debug.yaml`, will render any errors and exceptions to the browser will a full stack trace. Some of the messages are really clear and helpful, like `Can't write such and such file or folder`, but others are a bit more cryptic.

> Debugging is visible to everyone. Think hard before enabling any form of it on a live site.


## Logging {#logging}

Things go wrong. It's a part of life. Fortunately, we can see what went south using logs. There are a number of different logging methods available to you in Statamic.

Statamic comes pre-configured with error logging provided by Laravel and the powerful Monolog logging library. This allows you to use a number of logging handlers, should you wish to integrate with something more advanced.

### Configuring Handlers {#log-handlers}

Your logging configuration can be edited in the Debug settings section of the CP, or by editing the `loggers` key in `debug.yaml`.

You may configure multiple handlers at the same time by adding each one with their separate key.

```
loggers:
  file: true
  slack:
    token: ...
```

All handlers accept a `level` key, where you can specify the minimum severity level that should be logged for that handler. Here they are, from least to most severe: `debug`, `info`, `notice`, `warning`, `error`, `critical`, `alert`, `emergency`.

#### File {#log-file}

Out of the box, Statamic uses the `file` log handler. This will write to `local/storage/logs/statamic.log`.

You may customize the location of your log file by adding a `path` to the directory of your choice.

```
loggers:
  file:
    path: /home/logs
```

If you find your log file growing too large, you can enable daily files. This will create files
with datestamps. To do that, simply add `daily: true` to your `file` logger config.

```
loggers:
  file:
    daily: true
```

#### Browser {#log-brower}

Logs directly to your browser's console.

```
loggers:
  browser: true
```

#### Email {#log-email}

Sends an email using PHP's mail() function.

```
loggers:
  email:
    to: you@example.com
    from: me@example.com
    subject: An error has occurred
```

#### Hipchat {#log-hipchat}

Sends logs to a [Hipchat](https://www.hipchat.com/) room.

```
loggers:
  hipchat:
    token:
    room:
    name:
```

#### Slack {#log-slack}

Sends logs to a [Slack](https://slack.com/) channel.

```
loggers:
  slack:
    username: The user that will post the logs (might want a new one)
    channel: This should be surround by quotes and include the hash, i.e. `"#myloggingchannel"`
    token: Go to https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth-test-tokens (making sure you are logged in) and create one for your logging user
    icon_emoji: This is optional
```

#### Fleep {#log-fleep}

Sends logs to [Fleep.io](https://fleep.io/)

```
loggers:
  fleep:
    token:
```

#### Flowdock {#log-flowdock}

Sends logs to [Flowdock](https://www.flowdock.com/).

```
loggers:
  flowdock:
    token:
```

#### Syslog {#log-syslog}

Sends logs to your system log.

```
loggers:
  syslog:
    identity: Statamic
```

### Triggering Logs {#log-trigger}

Within code, you may trigger a log to be written (or sent, etc) by using Laravel's `Log` facade.

The logger provides the eight logging levels defined in RFC 5424: emergency, alert, critical, error, warning, notice, info and debug.

``` .language-php
Log::emergency($error);
Log::alert($error);
Log::critical($error);
Log::error($error);
Log::warning($error);
Log::notice($error);
Log::info($error);
Log::debug($error);
```

An array of contextual data may also be passed to the log methods. This contextual data will be formatted and displayed with the log message:

``` .language-php
Log::info('User failed to login.', ['id' => $user->id]);
```

As the facade belongs to the global namespace, remember to either `use Log` once, or do `\Log::info()`.

## The Debug Bar {#debug-bar}
The Debug Bar has a whole pile of useful information just waiting for you. Enable it in `System » Settings » Debugging` in the control panel, or with `debug_bar: true` in `site/settings/debug.yaml`.

Once enabled, the Debug Bar will present itself to you on the front-end of your site, fixed to the bottom of the browser. It has a number of tabs, each with its own purpose, as well as some data about your environment.

![Debug Bar](/assets/img/screenshots/debug-bar.png)

### Messages Tab {#debug-messages}

A generic catch-all for anything might dump data into the Debug Bar like a pile of garbage. The [dump modifier][dump], for example.

### Timeline Tab {#debug-timeline}

Shows you various server side processes and how long each took to render the page. Template parsing, tag rendering, and routing, for example.

### Exceptions Tab {#debug-exceptions}

Displays any caught and suppressed Exceptions.

### Events Tab {#debug-events}

Events are any system Events that were triggered during the loading of any given page request. Each Event can have listeners attached (in an Addon, for example) and corresponding actions run. It's just nice to know what's firing when.

### Variables Tab {#debug-vars}

Shows you all the data readily available to the page without needing to use [Tags][tags]. Page data, global variables, system settings, and more are all available in their pre-rendered data types allowing you to see [Carbon][carbon] objects, datestamps, scopes, and other interesting things.

### Sessions Tab {#debug-sessions}

Any session variables, flash data, and previous URL visited is shown here.

### Request Tab {#debug-request}

Information about the given page request is here, from `content_type` and `status_code` to any `POST` data and session attributes. Very handy.

## Utility Modifiers {#modifiers}

There are a few utility modifiers that let you debug data without the need for the Debug Bar. Check these bad boys out:

- [dump][dump]
- [console_log][console_log]
- [to_json][to_json]
- [debug][debug] (okay we fibbed, this one _does_ use the Debug Bar)
