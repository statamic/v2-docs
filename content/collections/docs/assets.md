overview: >
  Assets are files that you want to take special care of. Special files. Files you'd like to be friends with, and invite over for dinner. They allow you attach add extra data to your files, like alt tags and captions, and can be managed with special Tags and Fieldtypes.

## Overview {#overview}

> **Assets have recently been redesigned in Statamic 2.5.**  
[Check out the differences](#statamic-2-5)!

Assets can be images, videos, documents, zip files, or just about anything else you want to upload, manage, and display on your site. Assets are grouped into Containers, allowing you to keep your files organized.

![Some possible Assets](/assets/img/other/assets-filetypes.png)

## Containers {#containers}

Each asset container is represented by a yaml file inside  `site/content/assets`. We call the name of that file (e.g. `main.yaml`) the container ID.

The container holds the details about the root location of its assets. The location can be a local folder or credentials to an Amazon S3 bucket. See the [Asset Container Drivers](#asset-container-drivers) for more detail. The container also holds any additional asset data.

You can use the wizard in the Control Panel found at `Configure > Content > Assets`, or use the CLI command:

``` .language-cli
php please make:asset-container
```

## Managing Assets {#managing-assets}

Any files placed within an container's directory will be recognized and treated as assets. Subfolders are supported. Organize however you'd like.

You can reference assets within your content by using its URL. For example:

``` .language-yaml
title: Vacation to Italy
photos: 
  - /assets/vacations/italy/trevi-fountain.jpg
  - /assets/vacations/italy/colosseum.jpg
```

**Private Containers**

There's always an exception to the rule. If you have a private container, perhaps located above webroot to protect your downloads, you'll need to also reference the container ID in your filename. See [Private Assets](#private-assets) for more detail.

## Control Panel {#control-panel}

In the Control Panel you have a number of ways to interact with your Assets. 

You can use the Asset Manager to browse, edit, manage all your Assets across all containers, in one location.

<div class="screenshot">
  <h3>Asset Manager</h3>
  <img src="/assets/img/other/cp-asset-manager.png">
</div>

You can also use the [Assets fieldtype][assets-fieldtype] to browse, select, upload, reorder, and remove assets from your content.

<div class="screenshot">
  <h3>Asset Fieldtype</h3>
  <img src="/assets/img/other/cp-asset-fieldtype.png">
</div>


> Moving or renaming assets (either manually or through the Control Panel) will *not* automatically update your content, which may result in broken links. Thankfully the fix is only a Find & Replace away, right?


## Templating {#templating}

As assets are referenced in your content data by their URLs, you can iterate over the array directly:

```
{{ photos }}
  <img src="{{ value }}" />
{{ /photos }}
```

``` .language-output
<img src="/assets/vacations/italy/trevi-fountain.jpg" />
<img src="/assets/vacations/italy/colosseum.jpg" />
```

If your YAML contains a string instead of an array, or you'd like to target a specific item in the array, you can do that too:

``` .language-yaml
photo: /assets/jerky.jpg
photos:
  - /assets/bacon.jpg
  - /assets/whisky.jpg
```

```
{{ photo }}
{{ photos:1 }}
```

``` .language-output
/assets/jerky.jpg
/assets/whisky.jpg
```

For even more control, and to use data associated with your assets, you may use the [Assets Tag][assets-tag].

These tags will convert your URL references to Asset _objects_, which in turn contain all the additional data for you to use in your templates.

```
{{ assets:photos }}
  <img src="{{ url }}" alt="{{ alt }}" />
{{ /assets:photos }}
```

``` .language-output
<img src="/assets/vacations/italy/trevi-fountain.jpg" alt="The Trevi Fountain" />
<img src="/assets/vacations/italy/colosseum.jpg" alt="The Colosseum" />
```


## Additional asset data {#additional-data}

You may attach data (fields) to an asset just like you would with entries or pages. This is useful for things like alt text.

In the example above, we reference `{{ alt }}` within the `assets` tag pair. The value comes from what we've defined in the additional data.

Additional asset data is held within the asset container file, in an `assets` array. The relative path of the asset should be used as the key, with an array of data as the value.

Here's what a container might look like:

``` .language-yaml
title: Main Assets
path: assets
url: /assets
assets:
  vacations/italy/trevi-fountain.jpg:
    alt: The Trevi Fountain
  vacations/italy/colosseum.jpg:
    alt: The Colosseum
```

When moving or renaming an asset, be sure to update its key in this array.  
If you're using the Control Panel, this will be done automatically for you.

Note: If you don't need any additional asset data, you need nothing more than the URL reference. (That's one of the changes that landed in [Statamic 2.5 - check it out](#statamic-2-5).)


## Private Assets {#private-assets}

Sometimes it's handy to store assets that shouldn't be freely accessible through the browser.

This means you should put the container somewhere above the webroot, which in turn means that it doesn't have a URL, nor will any of its assets.

You can reference and access private assets with a few extra steps.

Since private assets have no URLs, you must reference them with their IDs, the container ID and the path joined by a double colon.

``` .language-yaml
top_secret_stuff: 
  - confidential::docs/evil-lair-blueprints.jpg
```

However, you can't iterate over `top_secret_stuff` directly since it doesn't contain working URLs. If working with images you'd like to display, you can  use the [Glide Tag][glide-tag] to transform it and render a copy in a public location. You can even just use the glide tag without any parameters.

```
{{ top_secret_stuff }}
  <img src="{{ glide:value }}" />
{{ /top_secret_stuff }}
```

Private assets may also have [their own data](#additional-data) which you can access using the [Assets tag][assets-tag] as mentioned earlier.


## Image Manipulation {#image-manipulation}

Image assets may be manipulated in a number of ways. You can alter size, color, quality, sharpness, and so o. We use [Glide](http://glide.thephpleague.com/) to power our image transformations.

Statamic provides a URL-based manipulation API through Glide. Everything runs through a manipulation route, which by default is `/img`. In other words, all images that start with `/img/*` will be manipulated.

For example, take this URL:

```
/img/assets/vacations/italy/trevi-fountain.jpg?w=100&h=100
```

- Statamic sees its an image manipulation URL because it starts with `/img/`
- It sees the path to an image: `assets/vacations/italy/trevi-fountain.jpg`
- It will manipulate and output an image based on the parameters. `?w=100&h=100`.

The appropriate way to generate these URLs in your templates is by using the [Glide Tag][glide-tag].

```
{{ glide src="/assets/vacations/italy/trevi-fountain.jpg"
         width="100" height="100" }}
```

The Glide tag can also accept asset IDs for private assets, and even external URLs. It's quite handy!  
Visit the [Glide Tag's docs][glide-tag] for more details.

### Manipulation Presets {#manipulation-presets}

You may define named presets to simplify your templates.

Within `site/settings/assets.yaml`, you can add a list of presets with the keys as their names, and the values as an array of raw [Glide API parameters](http://glide.thephpleague.com/1.0/api/quick-reference/). For example:

``` .language-yaml
image_manipulation_presets:
  sml:
    w: 200
    h: 200
  tall:
    w: 200
    h: 600
```

Whenever you upload a new image asset through the control panel, all of that image's presets will be created _automatically_.

To pre-generate the presets for existing assets, you can run the CLI command `php please assets:generate-presets`.

#### Queueing Presets {#queueing-presets}

Presets are generated when you upload the assets. Depending on how many presets you have, and what's involved in each, this may take a long time, or even cause the request to run out of memory.

You may push the presets into a queue so they can run in the background. Here's how:

- Ensure [Redis][redis] is installed and running on your server.
- Add `QUEUE_DRIVER=redis` to your `.env` file. [What's an .env file?](/environments).
- Run `php please queue:listen`

You can use whatever drivers Laravel supports for queues. On [Laravel Forge](https://forge.laravel.com), beanstalkd is enabled by default. 

## Asset Container Drivers {#asset-container-drivers}

The examples above assume you are storing your assets in folders within your site. However, it is possible to store them in other locations on your server, or even in the cloud using [Amazon S3](https://s3.amazonaws.com/).

Within each container’s configuration file, you may specify the `driver` and its various options.

### Local Filesystem {#local-driver}

When a container doesn’t have a driver specified, Statamic will assume it uses the `local` driver.

``` .language-yaml
title: Local Assets
path: path/to/asset/folder
url: /url/of/asset/folder
```

The path may be:

- A path relative to the main filesystem root. (eg. `path/to/assets`) This can be inside or outside your site’s root folder.
- An absolute path. (eg. `/var/www/example.com/assets`)
- An absolute path with an interpolated environment variable. (eg. `"{env‌:BASE_PATH}/assets"`)

As mentioned above, the url should be the location of the asset folder. If it’s located outside of the webroot, it’s inaccessible so you can just leave it blank. A container without a URL will be considered [private](#private-assets).

### Amazon S3 {#s3-driver}

To enable S3 assets in a container, you should set up your container configuration file like so:

``` .language-yaml
title: S3 Assets
driver: s3
key:     # Access Key ID
secret:  # Secret Access Key
bucket:  # The bucket name
region:  # The region code (eg. us-west-1)
path:    # A subfolder of the bucket, if you'd like
cache:   # A cache time in seconds. More info below.
```

The region codes can be tough to remember. [Here’s a list of them.](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region)


#### S3 Filesystem Caching {#s3-caching}

Amazon S3 requires API calls to retrieve information from Amazon. With a lot of files, and a lot of actions, this can very easily become slow.

The filesystem may be cached with [Redis][redis] to prevent repeated API calls.

- Ensure your server has Redis installed and running.
- Set the `cache` key in your container configuration file to the number of seconds a particular folder's contents should be cached.


## Statamic 2.5 Changes {#statamic-2-5}

Statamic 2.5 fundamentally changed how the asset system works, for ease of use _and_ for performance reasons. If you're coming from an earlier version, here's what you'll want to know:

- You no longer need to add each asset to a YAML file. If the file exists in the folder, it simply exists. No syncing necessary.
- The containers have moved from `site/storage/assets/[id]/container.yaml` to `site/content/assets/[id].yaml`.
- Instead of a separate `folder.yaml` file to track assets in each subfolder, all additional asset data is held in the container file.
- You now reference assets in your content with their URLs instead of IDs.
- Asset IDs _technically_ still exist, but now they are just `[container id]::[path to file]`. Not a crazy UUID.
- Asset IDs are used in your content for private containers.
- All of the required changes are handled during the upgrade process. It's all automatic.
