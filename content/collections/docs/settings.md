## General settings {#general}

Statamic stores its settings into groups located in `site/settings/[group].yaml`. These various files map to pages in
the CP under `Configure > Settings`.

The settings files are organized based on their general functions. For example, `assets.yaml` configures assets and image manipulation, `caching.yaml` for cache settings, `system.yaml` for general system settings, and so on.


## Addon settings {#addon}

Each addon can have their own settings file located in `site/settings/addons/addon_name.yaml`.

Addon settings can be overridden in your environment files. See below for more details.


## Environment Specific Settings {#environment}

Sometimes is beneficial to have different settings depending on where you are running the site. For instance, enabling debug mode when in development, but not in production. Or perhaps running some analytics javascript snippet only on production.

You can do this by overriding settings based on the environment you are serving the site.

## Maintenance Mode {#maintenance-mode}

When your site is in maintenance mode, a _Be Right Back_ message will be displayed for all requests. This could be
useful to "disable" your site while you perform updates.

To enable it run the `down` command, and to disable it run the `up` command:

``` .language-bash
php please down   # enable maintenance mode. take your site "down"
php please up     # disable. bring your site back "up"
```

This feature is the same as [Laravel's](https://laravel.com/docs/5.1/installation#maintenance-mode). You may customize
the view by adding a `503.html` error template to your theme.
