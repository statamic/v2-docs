## Data Structure {#data-structure}

By design Redactor saves HTML code.

``` .language-yaml
quote: |
  <blockquote>I signed up for Second Life about a year ago. Back then, my life was so great that I literally wanted a second one. Absolutely everything was the same... except I could fly.</blockquote><p>– Dwight Schrute</p>  
```

This is fine, but keep it in mind if you're using it for your `content` field and are using a markdown file.
Statamic automatically parses the `content` field as Markdown within `md` files.


## Redactor.js Configuration {#configuration}

You are able to set any number of predefined Redactor setting configurations. We give you two out of the box, but of
course you are free to modify those and add more.

``` .language-yaml
-
  name: Standard
  settings:
    buttons: [formatting, bold, italic, unorderedlist, orderedlist, html]
-
  name: Basic
  settings:
    buttons: [bold, italic]
```

Each item has a name, which is what you will see when configuring your fieldtype, and the settings themselves.

You can find these Redactor settings in `Configure > Settings > System` or within `statamic/settings/defaults/system.yaml`.

The `settings` value should be a YAML representation of the options object that will get passed into the Redactor jQuery
plugin. You are able to customize all of the Redactor options. You can [view the full list of settings in the Redactor documentation][redactor-docs].

Any settings and options available to the plugin can be set here. For example, if the docs say to use the following configuration object:

``` .language-javascript
$('textarea').redactor({
  formatting: ['p', 'blockquote', 'h2'],
  minHeight: 300
});
```

You would translate to YAML like so:

``` .language-yaml
-
  name: My Redactor Settings
  settings:
    formatting:
      - p
      - blockquote
      - h2
    minHeight: 300
```

*Note: Function type options (eg. callbacks) are not supported.*
