The Suggest fieldtype allows you to select from a number of suggested values. Treat it like a regular dropdown, or
start typing to narrow down the suggestions.

The values come from either a predefined array of `options`, or from a third-party suggest mode.

## Suggest Modes {#suggest-modes}

The suggestions in this field will normally come from the `options` array, which is a predefined list of values.

It is possible for an addon to provide suggestions to power this field. For example, an addon might create a suggest mode
that fetches tweets from a Twitter user's account. [Learn how to make a Suggest Mode](/knowledge-base/suggest-modes).
