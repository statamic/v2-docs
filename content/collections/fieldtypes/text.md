overview: >
  This is as basic as a fieldtype gets. In fact, it is _the_ default fieldtype. A plain, text input used to store string data. It also supports the ability to use any native HTML input types, though your mileage may vary with some of them.
options:
  -
    name: mode
    type: string

      You can pass the name of an [HTML5 input mode](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_input_types.asp) to switch its behavior. For example, `number`, or `email`.
