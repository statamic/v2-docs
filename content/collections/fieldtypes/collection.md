## Data Structure {#data-structure}

The Collections fieldtype is a [Relate fieldtype](/fieldtypes/relate), which means the Entries will be saved asÂ IDs.

``` .language-yaml
shows:
  - 892jfsd9a90as
  - 134jk1h78dfas
```

## Templating {#templating}

Use the [Relate tag](/tags/relate) to loop through the IDs and fetch the content data.

```
<ul>
  {{ relate:shows }}
    <li>{{ title }}</li>
  {{ /relate:shows }}
</ul>
```

``` .language-output
<ul>
  <li>Arrested Development</li>
  <li>Parks and Recreation</li>
</ul>
```
