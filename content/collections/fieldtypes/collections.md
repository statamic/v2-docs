## Data Structure {#data-structure}

The Collections fieldtype is a [Relate fieldtype](/fieldtypes/relate), and will save the collections as their handles (the folder name).

``` .language-yaml
listings:
  - blog
  - things
```

## Templating {#templating}

You're more than likely using this field as a way to dynamically display a collection.

Since the collection tag accepts a pipe-delimited list of collection names, you can join them together likeÂ this:

```
<ul>
  {{ collection from="{listings|piped}" }}
    <li>{{ title }}</li>
  {{ /collection }}
</ul>
```

``` .language-output
<ul>
  <li>A blog entry</li>
  <li>A thing entry</li>
  <li>etc</li>
</ul>
```
