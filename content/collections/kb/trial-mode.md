Statamic will run in _Trial Mode_ (previously _Developer Mode_) if you haven't specified a license key. Trial mode gets you access to
all the features of Statamic except that the Control Panel won't be accessible on a _public domain_.

Our [article about how licensing works][licensing] explains how we define a public domain.

This allows you to try out Statamic and even develop the site until you're ready to purchase a license.

What we recommend is to run Statamic locally on a `mysite.dev` domain. Then, when you're ready: purchase a license,
drop in the key, and deploy your site.
