## Usage

An `AssetCollection` is used to hold a collection of `Asset` objects.

This is not to be confused with an `AssetContainer`, which is the "source" where assets and folders are located.

The examples on this page use simple values to make things easier to understand.

## Creating a Collection

You can create an `AssetCollection` in a similar fashion to a [DataCollection][datacollection] or a regular collection.

```
$collection = collect_assets([1, 2, 3]);
```

## Available Methods

Just like regular collections, the following methods can be chained for fluent manipulation of the underlying array.

### To Array

This is just like a [DataCollection][datacollection]'s `toArray` method, except if any assets do not have corresponding
files, they will be filtered out from the array.

[datacollection]: /addons/api/datacollection
